# Chazona Codes: Documentation

The journey toward becoming a competent software developer is a long one, and it's easy to lose sight of how much is learned in the process. To prevent this, and as a way of beginning to try to give back to the development community that's done so much for me, I am going to begin to follow the advice given by Dan Abramov:

> Tip: if you're learning something, maintain your own doc with links to tutorials / examples / articles / videos / etc that you find.
>
> Better than bookmarks: more flexibility, doesn't have to feel tidy. Better than lists created by someone else: forces you to categorize and rank resources. Better than no list: you always have a starting point when stuck.

Here you will find a growing compendium of things I've learned or am learning, as well as resources that have gotten me here.

**Note: I may be and probably am wrong about some of what's written here. Learning is a process, and corrections in good faith will be welcomed.**
