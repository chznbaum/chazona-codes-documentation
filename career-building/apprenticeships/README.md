# Apprenticeships

Apprenticeships are a relatively under-utilized way to break into the tech industry. In this model, an apprentice gets paid a modest salary while working under more experienced developers.

Benefits to apprentice:

* Get paid to learn best practices in an intensive but understanding setting
* Gain legitimate work experience to form a great launching point into the industry
* Start off with a network of fellow developers with differing levels of experience

Benefits to companies:

* Work completed at a lower cost relative to that charged by more experienced developers
* Work quality-checked by experienced developers prior to being released
* Less outsourcing of work, creating fewer communication and time-zone difficulties
